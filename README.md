DiMoMe (digital mobile menu)  is a web app designed for any restaurant, bar or coffeeshop owners. The app aims to be a platform that provides easy access for customers to view digital menus in a comfortable to use format, readable on mobile devices, even allowing customers to filter products for allergens.

Since 2016 the EU has made it a requirement for any eatery to provide information on allergens and intolerances, not just on the request of the customer. DiMoMe provides an useful solution to this problem, as well as taking into account the effects of Covid-19 in the sector, like not sharing menus. 

Furthermore the use of DiMoMe will lead to savings in menu print costs. It's a win for customers and restauranteurs alike.
